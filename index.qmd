Hi! I am Manal K. Elzalabany. I am a multilingual epidemiologist & data analyst, working currently as data analyst in Imperial College London, UK. Previously worked as a research associate & data scientist in MPIDR, Germany & on COVID-19 detection & data analysis, outbreaks' response in WHO, and as a Lancet-associated researcher.

My research interests focus mainly on re/emerging infectious diseases and global health, using quantitative data methodologies.

I hold MSc Applied Statistics in Health Sciences from Strathclyde university, and an MPH in Epidemiology & Biostatistics from the American University of Beirut, 2018. I am an expert user of R/ RStudio, Rmarkdown & Quarto, and Shiny Web applications.
